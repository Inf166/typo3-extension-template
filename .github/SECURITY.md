## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We take the security of our project seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it to us privately, following the responsible disclosure guidelines described below. We appreciate your efforts in disclosing the issue to us responsibly and giving us the opportunity to address it before disclosing it publicly.

To report a security vulnerability, please contact our security team at [security@maispace.de](mailto:security@maispace.de). Provide detailed information about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, potential impact, and any related technical details.

We commit to acknowledging your report within 48 hours and will work with you to understand and address the issue promptly. Please note that this security policy covers only security vulnerabilities. For general bug reports or other inquiries, please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md or README.md file.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Share the vulnerability details only with us until we have had sufficient time to investigate and address the issue.
- Avoid sharing sensitive information or personally identifiable information (PII) during the disclosure process.
- Allow us a reasonable amount of time to investigate and address the reported vulnerability. We aim to provide regular updates on the progress.
- Refrain from accessing or modifying data or systems without explicit permission from the project maintainers.
- Do not publicly disclose the vulnerability until we have confirmed its resolution and agreed upon a coordinated disclosure timeline.
